# Memory Alarm Clock

This project started when I realeased I had difficukty to wake up in the morning so I thought that if I had an stimulus when the alarm clock rang it would be easier. The idea is to have an alarm clock that has some activities that you need to complete in order for the clock to stop ringing.

1. Memory game
